 * each update (resize), so [update] should be generally called with `true` parameter (camera should be centered).
 * Tries to keep the passed aspect ratio by applying letterboxing - horizontal or vertical black bars.
 *
 * On contrary to regular ScreenViewport, this viewport analyzes screen density (pixel per inch ratio) to preserve
 * correct look on every platform, including mobiles. This is very convenient for GUIs (especially when using fit
 * viewport with the same aspect ratio for game logic rendering), as they will not be scaled when the screen is resized
 * (comparably to using similarly to screen viewport), and yet should still look acceptable on mobile devices
 * (comparably to using fit viewport with a fixed world size).
 *
 * It is advised to pair this viewport with FitViewport - LetterboxingViewport can be used for the GUI, while
 * FitViewport is excellent for the actual (2D) game rendering.

 * @param targetPpiX this is the targeted pixel per inch ratio on X axis, which allows to scale the viewport
 *    correctly on different devices. Usually about 96 for desktop and WebGL platforms, 160 for mobiles.
 *    Make sure to call [updateScale] after changing this variable.
 * @param targetPpiY targeted pixel per inch ratio on Y axis. Usually about 96 for desktop and WebGL platforms, 160
 *    for mobiles. Make sure to call [updateScale] after changing this variable.
 * @param aspectRatio width divided by height. Will preserve this aspect ratio by applying letterboxing.
