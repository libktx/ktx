actor + action

// Now:
stage += action
actor += action
```

- **[CHANGE]** (`ktx-actors`) `SequenceAction.then` was removed. Using the method on a sequence no longer mutates
it for consistency with `Action.then`. `then` now unwraps actors from passed `SequenceActions`.
- **[CHANGE]** (`ktx-actors`) `ParallelAction.parallelTo` was removed. Using the method on a `ParallelAction` no longer
mutates it for consistency with `Action.parallelTo`. `parallelTo` now unwraps actors from passed `ParallelActions`.

    - `skipFrame` attempts to suspend the coroutine for at least one rendering frame.
    - `httpRequest` allows to perform an asynchronous HTTP request.
    - `schedule` and `interval` functions simplify LibGDX `Timer` API usage.
    - `AssetStorage` and associated asset loading utilities were temporarily removed. They will be added to a separate module.
    - Asynchronous tests were **significantly** simplified.

- **[CHANGE]** (`ktx-math`) Binary operators of `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Matrix3` and `Matrix4` (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) no
longer modify the first vector or matrix. Instead, they create new instances of vectors or matrices that store the
operation result. Use the assign operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`) instead to avoid creating new instances.

two inlined methods for each actor to support syntax both with braces (init block) and without. Now there is just one
factory method supporting both syntax variants per widget. This should not affect most application, but might require
Kotlin 1.2 usage.
- **[CHANGE]** (`ktx-ashley`) Default functional parameters were added to `create`, `entity` and `with`, simplifying
the implementation and making configuration blocks optional.
- **[CHANGE]** (`ktx-inject`) Parameters of `bindSingleton` consuming multiple classes have been swapped to be more
compatible with the `bind` functions.

parameters instead of `Class`, so now you can use `YourType::class` instead of more verbose `YourType::class.java`.
- **[FEATURE]** (`ktx-style`) Initiation blocks of `Skin` and Scene2D actor styles are now optional.
- **[FEATURE]** (`ktx-vis-style`) Initiation blocks of VisUI actor styles are now optional.

parameters in inlined functions.

expressions.

```kotlin
fun createCircle(body: Body) {
    // Before - would not compile without additional braces:
    body.circle(radius = 2f) {}
    
    // Now - braces are optional (lambda parameter defaults to no-op):
    body.circle(radius = 2f)
}
```

- **[CHANGE]** (`ktx-app`) `KtxGame` no longer supports fixed rendering time steps.
- **[FEATURE]** (`ktx-app`) Clearing screen on rendering is now optional when using `KtxGame`. Change `clearScreen` parameter to `false` to turn off screen clearing.

- **[CHANGE]** (`ktx-actors`) Existing `onChange`, `onClick`, `onKey`, `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, `onScrollFocus` and
`onKeyboardFocus` factory methods where renamed to `onChangeEvent`, `onClickEvent`, `onKeyEvent`, `onKeyDownEvent`,
`onKeyUpEvent`, `onScrollFocusEvent` and `onKeyboardFocusEvent` respectively. Their excessive amount of parameters,
useful only on rare occasions, led to unnecessary boilerplate during listeners creation. See `ktx-actors` file
documentation for migration guide.
