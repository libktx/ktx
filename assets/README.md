# KTX: assets management

Utilities for management of assets and heavy resources.

### Why?

LibGDX does a good job of helping you with assets through `AssetManager` and related APIs, but - as usual in case of
Java libraries - it does not allow to use the full potential of Kotlin features. This library aims to provide Kotlin
extensions and wrappers for the existing asset APIs to make assets usage more idiomatic in Kotlin applications.

### Guide

#### Assets

- `AssetManager.load` extension method can be used to schedule asynchronous loading of an asset. It returns an asset
wrapper, which can be used as delegate property, as well as used directly to manage the asset. Usually the asset will
not be available until `AssetManager.finishLoading` or looped `AssetManager.update` are called. You can use string file
paths or `AssetDescriptor` instances to load the asset. Usage example:

```Kotlin
// Eagerly loading an asset:
val wrapper = load<Texture>("test.png")
wrapper.finishLoading()
val texture = wrapper.asset

// Delegate field:
class Test(assetManager: AssetManager) {
  val texture by assetManager.load<Texture>("test.png")
  // Type of texture property is Texture.
}
```

- `AssetManager.getAsset` utility extension method can be used to access an already loaded asset, without having to pass
class to the manager to specify asset type. This is the preferred way of accessing assets from the `AssetManager`,
provided that they were already scheduled for asynchronous loading and fully loaded. Note that this method will fail if
asset is not loaded yet. Usage example:
```Kotlin
val texture: Texture = assetManager.getAsset("test.png")
```

- `AssetManager.loadOnDemand` is similar to the `load` utility method, but it provides an asset wrapper that loads the
asset eagerly on first get call. It will not schedule the asset for asynchronous loading - instead, it will block current
thread until the asset is loaded on the first access. Use for lightweight assets that should be (rarely) loaded only when
requested. Usage example:

```Kotlin
// Eagerly loading an asset:
val texture by assetManager.loadOnDemand<Texture>("test.png")
// Asset will be loaded upon first `texture` usage.

// Delegate field:
class Test(assetManager: AssetManager) {
  val texture: Texture by assetManager.loadOnDemand("test.png")
  // Asset will be loaded on first `texture` access.
}
```
- `AssetManager.unloadSafely` is a utility method that attempts to unload an asset from the `AssetManager`. Contrary to
`AssetManager.unload` call, this is a graceful method that will not throw any exceptions if the asset was not even
loaded in the first place. Typical usage: `assetManager.unloadSafely("test.png")`.
- `AssetManager.unload` extension method consuming a exception handling block was added, so you can gracefully handle
exception thrown during reloading. Note that `AssetManager` can throw `GdxRuntimeException` if the asset was not loaded yet.
- `AssetManager.getLoader` and `setLoader` extension methods with reified types added to ease handling of `AssetLoader`
instances registered in the `AssetManager`.
- The `AssetGroup` class is provided for easily grouping together assets so they can be managed as a group through calls 
such as `loadAll()` or `unloadAll()`. The intended use is to subclass `AssetGroup` and list its member assets as
properties using `AssetGroup.asset()` or `AssetGroup.delayedAsset()`. It also allows for using a common prefix for 
the file names of the group in case they are stored in a specific subdirectory.

#### `Disposable`

- Null-safe `Disposable.disposeSafely()` method was added. Can be called on a nullable `Disposable?` variable. Ignores
most thrown exceptions (except for internal JVM `Error` instances, which should not be caught anyway).
- `Disposable.dispose` with an exception catch block was added. Using `asset.dispose { exception -> doSomething() }`
syntax, you can omit a rather verbose try-catch block and handle exceptions with a Kotlin lambda.
- Any `Iterable` or `Array` storing `Disposable` instances will have `dispose`, `dispose { exception -> }` and
`disposeSafely` methods that dispose stored assets ignoring any `null` elements. This is a utility for disposing
collections of assets en masse.
- All exceptions get a utility `ignore()` method that you can switch at compile time (for debugging or logging) when
needed. See `Throwable.ignore()` documentation for further details.

#### `DisposableContainer`

- `DisposableContainer` is a `Disposable` that stores a set of `Disposable` instances to be disposed all at once.
When subclassed or used as a delegate via its `DisposableRegistry` interface, it provides an `alsoRegister` extension 
which allows easily adding items to the container when instantiating them so they'll automatically be disposed when
the containing class is.

#### `Pool`

- `Pool` instances can be invoked like a function to provide new instances of objects. Basically, this syntax: `pool()`
has the same effect as directly calling `pool.obtain()`.
- `Pool` instances can be invoked like a one argument function to free instances of objects. Basically, this syntax:
`pool(instance)` has the same effect as directly calling `pool.free(instance)`.
- New instances of `Pool` can be easily created with Kotlin lambda syntax using `pool` method. For example, this pool
would return new instances of `Entity` once empty: `pool { Entity() }`. Since this method is inlined, you should not
worry about unnecessary extra method calls or extra objects - the `Pool` implementations are prepared at compile time.

#### `FileHandle`

- Any Kotlin string can be quickly converted to a `FileHandle` instance using `toClasspathFile`, `toInternalFile`,
`toLocalFile`, `toExternalFile` or `toAbsoluteFile`. This is basically a utility for accessing `Gdx.files.getFileHandle`
method with a pleasant Kotlin syntax.
- `file` utility function allows to quickly obtain a `FileHandle` instance. It features an optional `type` parameter
which allows to choose the `FileType`, while defaulting to the most common `Internal`.

#### `FileHandleResolver`

- `FileType.getResolver` extension method was added to quickly construct `FileHandleResolver` instances for the chosen
file types.
- `FileHandleResolver.withPrefix` extension method was added to ease decoration of `FileHandleResolver` instances with
`PrefixFileHandleResolver`.
- `FileHandleResolver.forResolutions` extension method was added to ease decoration of `FileHandleResolver` instances
with `ResolutionFileResolver`.
- `resolution` factory function was added to construct `ResolutionFileResolver.Resolution` instances with idiomatic
Kotlin syntax.

#### Loaders

- `TextAssetLoader` allows to read text files asynchronously via the `AssetManager`. Very useful if you want to leverage
`AssetManager` loading and management API for a notable number of text files.

### Usage examples

Obtaining `FileHandle` instances:
```Kotlin
import com.badlogic.gdx.Files.FileType.*
import ktx.assets.*

val fileHandle = "my/file.png".toInternalFile()

val internal = file("my/file.png")
val absolute = file("/home/ktx/my/file.png", type = Absolute);
```

Working with LibGDX `Pool`:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

val pool = pool { "String." }
val obtained: String = pool() // "String."
pool(obtained) // Returned instance to the pool.
```

Gracefully disposing assets:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

texture.disposeSafely()
music.dispose { exception ->
  println(exception.message)
}
```

Disposing collections of assets:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

val textures: Array<Texture> = getMyTextures() // Works with any Iterable, too!

textures.dispose() // Throws exceptions.
textures.disposeSafely() // Ignores exceptions.
textures.dispose { exception -> } // Allows to handle exceptions.
```

Registering `Disposable`s for disposal when the containing class is disposed:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

class MyScreen: Screen, DisposableRegistry by DisposableContainer() {
  val assetManager = AssetManager().alsoRegister()
  val spriteBatch = SpriteBatch().alsoRegister()
  // ...
}
```

Manually disposing registered `Disposable`s for custom disposal handling or because the superclass hides access to the 
registry delegate's `dispose` method:
```
import ktx.assets.*

class MyScreen: ScreenAdapter(), DisposableRegistry by DisposableContainer() {
  // ...
  override fun dispose() {
    registeredDisposables.dispose() { exception ->
      Gdx.app.error("MyScreen.dispose()", exception.message)
    }
  }
}
```

Passing a `DisposableContainer` as a primary constructor parameter so its `dispose` method can be accessed in a class
whose superclass hides the delegate's `dispose` method:
```
import ktx.assets.*

class MyScreen(
  private val registry: DisposableRegistry = DisposableContainer()
): ScreenAdapter(), DisposableRegistry by registry() {
  // ...
  override fun dispose() {
    registry.dispose()
  }
}
```
Scheduling assets loading by an `AssetManager`:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

assetManager.load<Texture>("image.png")
```

Using field delegate which will eventually point to a `Texture` (after its fully loaded by an `AssetManager`):
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*
import com.badlogic.gdx.assets.AssetManager

class MyClass(assetManager: AssetManager) {
  val image by assetManager.load<Texture>("image.png")
  // image is Texture == true
}
```

Immediately extracting a **fully loaded** asset from an `AssetManager`:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

val texture: Texture = assetManager.getAsset("image.png")
// Or alternatively:
val texture = assetManager.getAsset<Texture>("image.png")
```

Using an asset loaded on the first getter call rather than scheduled for loading:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*
import com.badlogic.gdx.assets.AssetManager

class MyClass(assetManager: AssetManager) {
  val loadedOnlyWhenNeeded by assetManager.loadOnDemand<Texture>("image.png")
  // loadedOnlyWhenNeeded is Texture == true
}
```

Unloading an asset from an `AssetManager`, ignoring exceptions:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

assetManager.unloadSafely("image.png")
```

Unloading an asset from an `AssetManager`, handling exceptions:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

assetManager.unload("image.png") { exception -> exception.printStackTrace() }
```

Managing `AssetLoader` instances of an `AssetManager`:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*

// Settings custom AssetLoader:
val myCustomLoader = CustomLoader()
assetManager.setLoader(myCustomLoader) // No need to pass class.

// Accessing an AssetLoader:
val loader = assetManager.getLoader<MyAsset>()
```

Creating an `InternalFileHandleResolver`:

```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.getResolver
import com.badlogic.gdx.Files.FileType

val resolver = FileType.Internal.getResolver()
```

Decorating `FileHandleResolver` with `PrefixFileHandleResolver`:

```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*
import com.badlogic.gdx.Files.FileType

val resolver = FileType.Internal.getResolver().withPrefix("folder/")

```

Decorating `FileHandleResolver` with `ResolutionFileResolver`:
```Kotlin
import ktx.assets.*
import com.badlogic.gdx.Files.FileType

val resolver = FileType.Internal.getResolver().forResolutions(
    resolution(width = 800, height = 600),
    resolution(width = 1024, height = 768)
)
```

A simple application that registers `TextAssetLoader`, reads a file asynchronously, prints it and terminates:

```Kotlin
import com.badlogic.gdx.ApplicationAdapter
import com.badlogic.gdx.Gdx
import com.badlogic.gdx.assets.AssetManager
import ktx.assets.TextAssetLoader
import ktx.assets.load
import ktx.assets.setLoader

class MyApp : ApplicationAdapter() {
  private val manager = AssetManager()

  override fun create() {
    manager.setLoader(TextAssetLoader())
    manager.load<String>("file.txt")
  }

  override fun render() {
    if (!manager.update()) {
      println("Loading...")
    } else {
      println(manager.get<String>("file.txt"))
      Gdx.app.exit()
    }
  }
}
```

Using `AssetGroup` to schedule loading and manage a group of assets:

```Kotlin
/** Groups UI-related assets. */
class UIAssets(manager: AssetManager) : AssetGroup(manager, filePrefix = "ui/") {
  // The assets are listed using asset(),
  // so they are immediately queued for loading when the object is created.  
  val skin by asset<Skin>("skin.json")
  val clickSound by asset<Sound>("mapScreen.wav")
}

val uiAssets = UIAssets(manager)
// No need to queue the assets. They are queued when creating the group object.

// Block until they are finished loading:
uiAssets.finishLoading() 
// Note that classic incremental loading with update() is also available.

// Accessing assets - same as with regular properties:
uiAssets.skin
uiAssets.clickSound

// Disposing of the assets:
uiAssets.unloadAll()
```

Using `AssetGroup` with assets loaded on demand once needed:

```Kotlin
/** An asset groups that loads the assets on demand on first access. */
class MapScreenAssets(manager: AssetManager) : AssetGroup(manager, filePrefix = "mapScreen/") {
  // The assets are listed using delayedAsset(),
  // so they are loaded on demand on the first access
  // or have to be scheduled for loading manually with loadAll().
  val atlas by delayedAsset<TextureAtlas>("map.atlas")
  val music by delayedAsset<Music>("mapScreen.ogg")
}

val mapScreenAssets = MapScreenAssets(manager)
// Assets are not queued for loading just yet.

// To load the assets, you can access them with properties:
mapScreenAssets.atlas
// Note that this will block until the asset is loaded.

// You can schedule them for asynchronous loading to avoid thread blocking:
mapScreenAssets.loadAll()
if (mapScreenAssets.update()) {
  // The member assets are now ready to use.
} else {
  // Continue showing loading prompt.
}

// Disposing of the assets:
mapScreenAssets.unloadAll()
```

#### Implementation tip: type-safe assets

Create an enum with all assets of the selected type. Let's assume our application stores all images in `assets/images`
folder in `PNG` format. Given `logo.png`, `player.png` and `enemy.png` images, we would create a similar enum:

```Kotlin
enum class Images {
  logo,
  player,
  enemy;

  val path = "images/${name}.png"
  fun load() = manager.load<Texture>(path)
  operator fun invoke() = manager.getAsset<Texture>(path)
  companion object {
    lateinit var manager: AssetManager
  }
}
```

Operator `invoke()` function brings asset accessing boilerplate to mininum: `enumName()`. Thanks to wildcard imports, we
can access `logo`, `player` and `enemy` enum instances directly:

```Kotlin
import com.example.Images.*

// Setting AssetManager instance:
Images.manager = myAssetManager

// Scheduling logo loading:
logo.load()

// Getting Texture instance of loaded logo:
val texture = logo()

// Scheduling loading of all assets:
Images.values().forEach { it.load() }

// Accessing all textures:
val textures = Images.values().map { it() }
```

### Alternatives

- [`ktx-assets-async`](../assets-async) provides an alternative asset manager with non-blocking API based on coroutines.
In contrary to LibGDX `AssetManager`, **KTX** `AssetStorage` supports concurrent loading of assets on multiple threads
performing asynchronous operations.
- [libgdx-utils](https://bitbucket.org/dermetfan/libgdx-utils/) feature an annotation-based asset manager implementation
which easies loading of assets (through internal reflection usage).
- [Autumn MVC](https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-lml/tree/master/mvc) is a [Spring](https://spring.io/)-inspired
model-view-controller framework built on top of LibGDX. It features its own asset management module which loads and
injects assets into annotated fields thanks to reflection.
- [Kiwi](https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-lml/tree/master/kiwi) library has some utilities for assets handling, like
graceful `Disposable` destruction methods and LibGDX collections implementing `Disposable` interface. It is aimed at
Java applications though - **KTX** syntax should feel more natural when using Kotlin.
